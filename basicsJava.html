        // camelCase
        // var is less concerned with scope
        var firstName = "Ian"; // this is a string variable

        // JavaScript is a dynamically-type language
        // JavaScript tries to guess what is the data type of your variables

        let age = 20; // JavaScript will assume this is an integer (int) - a whole number

        let pi = 3.14; // JavaScript will assume this is a float (decimal points)

        let valid_input = false; // JavaScript will assume that this is a boolean - true/false

        let last_name = ""; // wewill set up the varible now, and get the value later

        // the third section of the for loop is where we change the value of our conter variable (i)
